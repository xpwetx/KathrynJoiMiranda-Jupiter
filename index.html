  <p>My name is Kathryn but people call me Kaye. I'm currently a stay at home mom of two small children. I have no prior
    experience with coding, however I've always had an interest in technology. I decided to apply to Code the Dream in
    order to expand my knowledge of computers and programming.</p>
